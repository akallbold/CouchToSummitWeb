# Couch to Summit

Couch to Summit is an application designed to help you prepare for your next mountain adventure. Whether you’re starting from the couch or simply looking for a structured training plan, this app will guide you step-by-step toward your climbing goal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will automatically reload if you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the documentation on running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production in the `build` folder.  
This process bundles and optimizes the code for best performance. Your app is then ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you “eject,” you cannot go back.

If you are dissatisfied with the current build tools or configurations, you can run `npm run eject` at any time. This step moves all configuration files and dependencies directly into your project, giving you complete control. However, all commands except `eject` will continue to function as they did before.
